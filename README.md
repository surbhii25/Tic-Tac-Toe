# TIC TAC TOE

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

## Winning Strategy – An Interesting Fact
If both the players play optimally then it is destined that you will never lose (“although the match can still be drawn”). It doesn’t matter whether you play first or second.In another ways – “ Two expert players will always draw ”.
Isn’t this interesting ?
